# Slax's Anthology - A Vanilla-esque Balatro Mod
A combination of well-thought-out ideas, shitposts, and almost everything in between; balanced alongside Vanilla Balatro mechanics and playstyles!

### New Jokers!
This mod contains a selection of balanced but unique Jokers to spice up the traditional Balatro gameplay. Build powerful suit builds with the Regalia Jokers, or buff up your Seals with the Candle Jokers!<br>
Most of the cards complement pre-existing playstyles, while some create their own way to beat the Boss Blind!<br>
Be on the lookout for the powerful new "Ordinal" rarity jokers: expensive, rare, but very powerful.<br>

### New Consumables!
This mod also contains 10 "gwa" cards, funny little cats that all do different things when used!

### A Balanced Selection!
Slax's Anthology aims to be faithful to Vanilla Balatro's sense of balance, with powerful jokers costing respectively more amounts of money- yet with the right build can be quite high-scoring. Go experiment a little!
